# react-math-keyboard

This library will provide a customizable, pretty, mobile-friendly keyboard to a MathQuill input.

This is using a fork of MathQuill in order to use the comma as a decimal separator and the symbol "\\times" instead of "\\cdot" for multiplication.

In the future this library will be used by [Mathlive.fr](https://www.mathlive.fr).

## ðŸš§ Work in progress !

This library is not ready to be used yet. It is still in beta and the architecture may very well completely change in the future.
